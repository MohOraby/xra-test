# You can see the documention by visiting /api-docs
  
# Hosted the server on vercel at https://xra-test.vercel.app/
   Please note that swagger UI at /api-docs is not working correctly (styling not loaded) at vercel which can by solved by saving swagger assets (CSS and JS files) as a part of the project, but that will make the project files bigger
